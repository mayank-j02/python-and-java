1.Take a text file,go line by line,and then convert it into a 2D ASCII character matrix.Make sure the 2D matrix is symmetrical.

After that make changes to the 2D matrix,convert it back into a text file and see if the changes you made were made and if they were appropriate.

eg

Text file:

Hello World

I am from ECS

2D Matrix

72 101 108 108 111 32 87 111 114 108 100

73 32 97 109 32 102 114 111 109 32 69 67 83

2. Study about CSV file format and other types of file format that are useful for data logging.

Write a Java code such that it takes a text file,and writes all the data in that text file,to an excel file and displays the excel file.

After that,convert that excel file and itâ€™s data into a CSV file using Java.
