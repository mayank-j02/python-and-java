In the following code I have created a JavaFX project for GPA calculation.
In the following project a user has to give input of its subject name, grade and credit, the grade is converted to point and the gpa is calculates.
The user can give the input of his grade in both lower and uppercase.
There are buttons one to reset the calculator one to add more subjects and one to get the final output.
The subject, grade and credit are printed in the list view.
